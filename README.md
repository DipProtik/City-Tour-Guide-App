# City-Tour-Guide-App
This is a sophisticated android application that i built for my 3rd year project.
Here i have used several google map api's, weather api that uses the Volley library.
I also included a notepad for the users to record their visiting dates of a particular place using the SQLite database.
A quick overview of the project can be seen in the project presentation file that i have included amongst the files above.
Thank you.
